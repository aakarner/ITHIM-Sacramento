## Integrated Transport and Health Impact Modelling Tool (ITHIM) 
### Sacramento Area Race/Ethnicity and Income

This site is an application of the [ITHIM model](http://www.cedar.iph.cam.ac.uk/research/modelling/ithim/) created at the [UK Center for Diet and Activity Research](http://www.cedar.iph.cam.ac.uk/). This application of the tool was implemented to do two main things:
<ol>
<li>To visualize how different people travel in the Sacramento area and how active they are </li>
<li>To look at how things would change under different scenarios in which the probability of active transportation increases </li>
</ol>

This model includes contributions by:   

- Alex Karner
- Dana Rowangould
- Yizheng Wu
- Ofurhe Igbinedion
